        <h2 class="c1" id="h.umj2ijnztes"><span class="c0">Welcome to Business Incentives!</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Thanks for using our services (&ldquo;Services&rdquo;). The Services are provided by Business Incentives, LLC (&ldquo;Business Incentives&rdquo;), located in Grand Junction, Colorado, United States.</span></p>
        <p class="c4 text-center"><span class="c2"><strong>*** By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms, so please read them carefully. ***</strong></span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.1a8550mjxc34"><span class="c0">Using our Services</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">Do not misuse our Services, for example, do not interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are investigating suspected misconduct.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content that you access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Do not remove, obscure or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">Our Services display some content that is not Business Incentives&rsquo;. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please do not assume that we do.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages and other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">Our Service is available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.xfg0bmna88u4"><span class="c0">Your Business Incentives Account</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">You may need a Business Incentives Account in order to use some of our Services. You may create your own Business Incentives Account. To protect your Business Incentives Account, keep your password confidential. You are responsible for the activity that happens on or through your Business Incentives Account. Try not to reuse your Business Incentives Account password on third-party applications. If you learn of any unauthorised use of your password or Business Incentives Account, please reset your password.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.97vx7nppril9"><span class="c0">Privacy and Copyright Protection</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c7">Business Incentives&rsquo; </span><span class="c7">Privacy Policy</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that Business Incentives can use such data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.h47434ya3ld3"><span class="c0">Your Content in our Services</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">Our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Business Incentives (and those we work with) a worldwide licence to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes that we make so that your content works better with our Services), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content. </span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">The rights that you grant in this licence are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our Services, and to develop new ones. Some Services may offer you ways to access and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Make sure that you have the necessary rights to grant us this licence for any content that you submit to our Services.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.bm9oc1rph51"><span class="c0">Modifying and Terminating our Services</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">You can stop using our Services at any time, although we would be sorry to see you go. Business Incentives may also stop providing Services to you or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">We believe that you own your data, and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to remove information from that Service.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.5ovprzd26kzy"><span class="c0">Business uses of our Services</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify Business Incentives and its affiliates, officers, agents and employees from any claim, action or proceedings arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgements, litigation costs and legal fees.</span></p>
        <h2 class="c1" id="h.yq664j3rx56g"><span class="c0">About these Terms</span></h2>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c2">We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We&rsquo;ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply retrospectively. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">If there is any inconsistency between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">These terms govern the relationship between Business Incentives and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</span></p>
        <p class="c4"><span class="c2">If you do not comply with these terms and we do not take action immediately, this doesn&rsquo;t mean that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).</span></p>
